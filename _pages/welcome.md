When we interact with others, we never have the full story. No matter how much we sometimes wish to, we can’t access others’ mental states — their thoughts, emotions, desires, *intentions*. Yet intentions are central to so many of the (social, moral, legal) judgments we make each day. So, as we navigate the social world, we rely on our ability to generate *inferences* about others’ intentions by observing their behavior. 

How do we synthesize the mass of social information around us in order to make accurate inferences about others’ intentions? How does *what we see* influence our inferences, and conversely, how do our inferences influence what we see? How are our inferences biased — by our motivations, expectations, social relationships, and obligations — for better or for worse?
